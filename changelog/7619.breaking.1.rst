The types of many columns in the results table returned by the HEKClient have been changed.
Columns which correspond to quantities with units are now returned as `~astropy.units.Quantity` objects rather
than arrays.
Columns which correspond to times are now returned as `~astropy.time.Time` objects rather than strings.
Columns which correspond to coordinates are now returned as `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` objects rather than
arrays or chain code strings.
