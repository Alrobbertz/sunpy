The `~sunpy.net.hek.HEKClient` now merges columns ``event_coord1``, ``event_coord2`` and ``event_coord3``
into a new column called ``event_coord`` that returns a `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` object.
``event_coord1``, ``event_coord2`` and ``event_coord3`` are all dropped as columns from the table.
Columns which correspond to only units are also dropped.
If you need these columns, the unparsed HEK results can be accessed via the ``.raw`` attribute on the HEK result.
