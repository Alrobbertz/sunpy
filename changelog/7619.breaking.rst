The `~sunpy.net.hek.HEKClient` now merges columns ``event_coord1``, ``event_coord2`` and ``event_coord3``
into a new column called ``event_coord`` that returns a `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` object.
``event_coord1``, ``event_coord2`` and ``event_coord3`` are all dropped as columns from the table.
Columns which correspond to only units are also dropped.
